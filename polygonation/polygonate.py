"""
Module to turn a set of points into a set of convex nonoverlapping polygons.
Done by identifying the removable walls, and then removing one of them.
Rinse-repeat until no further walls can be removed.

Not optimized or anything. For example, all candidiates are recalculated
after removing a wall, and the Delaunay grid is calculated several times.

# Find out, which lines could be removed and keep convexness of shape.
# Method: check each pair of neighboring shapes, and see, if union of them
# would still be convex.
# How to check for convexness of a shape:
# . possibility 1: all points are in the convex hull.
# . possibility 2: going around the polygon, the angle change between 
#   consequetive lines always has the same sign --> only works in 2D
